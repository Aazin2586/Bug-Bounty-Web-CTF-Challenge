[Vulnerability Report]
Challenge: Broken Access Control (DOM Logic)
Severity: Critical
Status: Confirmed

[Question]
The system administrators believe their internal logs are safe from prying eyes. Can you prove them wrong?

[Hints]
1. Sometimes, what you can't see on the screen is still present in the HTML code.
2. If the frontend hides a button, try calling the backend API directly.

[Description]
The "Administration Console" functionality is hidden only by client-side JavaScript (`style="display: none;"`). The backend API endpoint (`/api.php?action=get_admin_logs`) does not enforce role-based access control (RBAC), allowing any authenticated user (including guests) to retrieve sensitive logs.

[Exploitation Steps]
1. Log in to the application as a Guest.
2. Open Browser Developer Tools (F12).
3. Inspect the sidebar navigation. Locate the hidden `#nav-admin` element.
4. Remove `style="display: none;"` (or run `app.nav('admin')` in the Console).
5. Click the "Administration" button.
6. The application fetches `/api.php?action=get_admin_logs`.
7. Observe the "System Activity Logs" panel.

[Finding]
The logs contain a critical information leak:
"Emergency Patch Applied: flag{d0m_l0g1c_byp4ss}"

[Remediation]
Implement strict server-side role validation. The `get_admin_logs` endpoint must verify the user's role (e.g., `if ($user['role'] !== 'admin') die()`) before executing any logic or returning data. Client-side hiding is security through obscurity and is ineffective.
