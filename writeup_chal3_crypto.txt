[Vulnerability Report]
Challenge: Distributed Secret Fragments (Crypto Misuse)
Severity: Medium
Status: Confirmed

[Description]
The application distributes sensitive configuration fragments across multiple disparate API endpoints. These fragments are obfuscated using a custom encoding scheme (Base64 + ROT13) but are delivered to client-side code where they can be intercepted and reconstructed.

[Exploitation Steps]
1. Intercept Network Traffic (Developer Tools -> Network) while browsing the app.
2. Identify anomalous fields in JSON responses:
   - `get_balance`: `debug_trace_id` = "QVJLTEZf"
   - `get_admin_logs`: `sync_ver` = "UEJSRV8="
   - `admin_debug` (Requires Admin): `ref_pointer` = "WFJMXzc3"
3. Reverse the Encoding Scheme (Base64 Decode -> ROT13):
   - "QVJLTEZf" -> "ARKHF_" -> "NEXUS_"
   - "UEJSRV8=" -> "PBRE_" -> "CORE_"
   - "WFJMXzc3" -> "XRL_77" -> "KEY_77"
4. Reassemble the Master Key: "NEXUS_CORE_KEY_77".
5. Submit this key to the "System Config" panel validation endpoint.

[Finding]
The system validates the key and returns the configuration hash:
HASH: flag{crypt0_fr4gm3nt_m1sus3}

[Remediation]
Never send partial secrets or unused "debug" data to the client. Validate configurations purely server-side. Remove all hardcoded encoding logic from the frontend transparency layer.
